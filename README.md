## Chapter I: Piscine

### What is a Piscine?
A Piscine is a rigorous educational program that divides a project into multiple small modules, with each module introducing new concepts or technologies related to a specific subject, language, or paradigm. This program challenges participants to learn and apply their knowledge on a daily basis.

### Key Points for Success
To successfully complete a Piscine, it's important to adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Diversify Your Work**: You cannot validate the Piscine by focusing on only one or two projects. Embrace the variety of modules.

2. **Daily Submissions**: Strive to submit your work every day, even if it's incomplete. Consistent effort is crucial.

3. **Two Weeks Commitment**: Be prepared to dedicate at least two weeks to the Piscine. It's an intensive program that demands time and effort.

4. **Depot Closures**: Remember that initialized depots are automatically closed after one day. Plan accordingly.

5. **Peer Evaluations**: You have two days to complete the required peer evaluations for each module.

6. **Retries**: It is possible to retry your modules without waiting. Don't hesitate to make improvements.

7. **Collaboration**: It is highly recommended to collaborate with fellow students. Working together can enhance your learning experience.
